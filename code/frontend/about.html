              I'm all about diving headfirst into the exciting world of tech,
              especially blockchain – it's just fascinating! My adventure in
              tech has taken me from being the go-to solutions person to weaving
              magic with Web3 systems and apps. 🚀 It's all about innovation and
              bringing fresh, cool ideas to life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Studied CIS at Georgia State University 🎓 and I can chat in
              Mandarin too. I’m not just about creating solutions – I'm here to
              shape the future of tech, one code line at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
              And guess what? I took on the Cloud Resume Challenge! Built this
              site from scratch using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and AWS cloud tech.
              🌐 It's not just about flexing my tech muscles, but also about
              constantly learning and applying new skills. As a tech enthusiast,
              I'm all in for mixing innovation with hands-on expertise. Let's
              ride the tech wave together! 🌊
