# Register Your Domain

## Registering a Domain with Route53
- Log into the *IAM Admin User* of the *General* AWS account.
- From the *Console Home*, you will see a *Search* bar at the top of the screen. Search and click on `Route 53` to open the *S3 dashboard*. Click **Create Get started**.
- Select *Register a domain* and click **Get started**.
- In the first box where it says *Search for domain*, go ahead and enter what you would like your domain to be and hit **Search**.<br>
If available, then you can click **Select**. Otherwise, AWS will provide *Suggested available domains* for you below.<br>
Once you have your domain selected and verified, click **Proceed to checkout**.
- On the *Pricing* page, you can select the *Duration (price)* and optionally select if you want to toggle on or off *Auto-renew*. Click **Next** when you're ready. 
- Enter your contact information and click **Next**.
- Review the info and if everything looks correct, then select *I have read and agree to the Amazon Route 53 Domain Name Registration End User Agreement* and click **Submit**.
- On the left hand menu bar, click **Requests** under the *Domains* section. At this point, the domain is registering and will take some time to complete.<br>
We will need to wait for the *status* to update from *In progress* to *Successful*.<br>
You may receive an email to verify your email address for the domain. Be sure to do so or your domain may be suspended.
