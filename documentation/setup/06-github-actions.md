# GitHub Actions
<sub> The instructions below will assume your source code is hosted on GitHub. </sub>
## Create Workflow
- Navigate to your repo and click on **Actions** in the tab options at the top of the screen.
- We will be building a new workflow so click on **set up a workflow yourself**. This will create a new `main.yml` file under a `.github/workflows` directory in your repo. I will name my file to [`deploy-to-s3.yml`](https://github.com/JulianChuan/cloud-resume/.github/workflows/deploy-to-s3.yml)
