  > Make sure to replace the placeholders `your-aws-region`, `your-s3-bucket-name`, and `./path/to/local/directory` with your actual AWS region, S3 bucket name, and local directory path respectively.
  
  Additionally, you need to set up AWS access keys as GitHub secrets named `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` with the appropriate IAM permissions to access the S3 bucket.
  
  This workflow will trigger on every push to the `main` branch and deploy the contents of the specified local directory to the specified S3 bucket using AWS credentials configured via secrets.
